song = The Times They Are A-Changin
verse1 = Come gather round, people \
    Wherever you roam \
    And admit that the waters \
    Around you have grown \
    And accept it that soon \
    You ll be drenched to the bone \
    If your time to you is worth savin \
And you better start swimmin \
Or you ll sink like a stone \
For the times they are a-changin

verse2 = Come writers and critics
    Who prophesize with your pen
    And keep your eyes wide
    The chance wont come again
    And dont speak too soon
    For the wheel s still in spin
    And there s no tellin who
    That it s namin
    For the loser now
    Will be later to win
    For the times they are a-changin
